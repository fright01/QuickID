Works for all Minecraft versions.

This is a basic item ID lookup.
It's quick and easy.

I was sick of all the slow search tools, so here is a better one.
It is NOT case sensitive.
You don't have to hit enter.
You can search by ID # as well.

Please, if you have any suggestions, questions or comments, please post them. They really help and I would like to expand this project.

Made it detect and work with custom texture packs. Simply replace the terrain.png and items.png with your custom one. The thumbnail will be resized to 32x32 (for viewing purposes).
Note: special.png cannot change because it is so irregular and inconsistent.

Fixed a parsing bug. Now this should work for any update.
I plan on updating the download, but if I am slow, simply take the InvEdit files (items.txt, items.png, special.png, and terrain.png) and place them with the jar. The file will simply read from those. If you find a value in those files is wrong, eg. you see a purple square for redstone dust, just change them accordingly.

Updated for cookies! :)

*Updated: 3/29/2011* :
Added Images. Using a new structure for getting information. (Thx InvEdit for files).
Sorry about having you make a shortcut, but the extra few images help things a lot.

Removed bug involving white-spacing interfering with searches.
